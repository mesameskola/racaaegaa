          The Rose team reflects our local community – diverse, welcoming, and
          deeply connected. Equity and inclusion are not just ideals, but daily
          practices. Our chefs, driven by a passion for local and sustainable
          ingredients, collaborate closely with our front of house team,
          creating an unfussy dining experience. We foster a sense of community
          within our team, ensuring that every member contributes their unique
          talents to the Rose experience.
